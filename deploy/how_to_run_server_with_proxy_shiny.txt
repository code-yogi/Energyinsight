To run the server with shiny behind a proxy, the Django server must be run behind nginx and use nginx to proxy request to the shiny address. 

Note nginx is only available in linux machine. 

=================== Step 1.  Install uwsgi. ==========================

The uwsgi is a socket to connect nginx (the web server) to Django 

pip install uwsgi

To test if uwsgi is installed correctly, 

cd into the energyinsight2.0 folder. Then run 

uwsgi --http :8002 --module energyinsight.wsgi 

Note the "energyinsight.wsgi" points to the energyinsight/wsgi.py file. Make sure the django project does have this file


If this works, it means uwsgi is successfully installed. When combining with nginx, we will use socket to run the server, which is better performance

uwsgi --socket :8002 --module energyinsight.wsgi 

Note the --socket option create a file mysite.socket in the directory, it is accessed by nginx. If nginx cannot access it, it means the file permission is not set correctly. try:

uwsgi --socket :8002 --module energyinsight.wsgi --chmod-socket=666

=================== Step 2. Install nginx ===========================

Now install and setup the web server

sudo apt-get install nginx


To start the server:

sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start|restart|stop

To link the web server to django, the configuration file for nginx is already in energyinsight2.0. It is called energyinsight_nginx.conf
either copy this file to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ or make a sim link to it. 

sudo ln -s energyinsight_nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/  

This file needs to edited to make it work. I haven't figure out a way to use variable yet. 

In line 4 and line 41, The location of "mysite.socket" and "uwsgi_params" path need to point to energyinsight2.0

======================== Step 3. Test =========================

Inside the energyinsight2.0 folder, run both 

sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start

and 

uwsgi --socket :8002 --module energyinsight.wsgi 

Then try to do 

http://localhost:8001/protected/energyinsight/summary/

If this works, it means the proxy to shiny server is working

Then try 

http://localhost:8001/proxy/energyinsight/summary/

This is behind a django authentication service. 

If this also works, uncomment the #internal. So that public link http://localhost:8001/protected/energyinsight/summary/ no longer work.
