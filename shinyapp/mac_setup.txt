# This document is to setup shiny server on docker image and run the docker engine on mac. So that developing shiny app would be much easier.



1. Install docker for mac.

https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/

Click on Docker for Mac and download the dmg and install it.
(Docker Toolbox is similar but they use different virtual enviroment, I only tried Docker for mac)


2. Install the image
After install, open terminal and check if docker is installed successfully by typing 

docker run hello-world

If you see output, then it's good

Then type 

docker pull shrektan/shiny

This will pull the image. 

Then you can run this by typing

docker run -p 3838:3838 shrektan/shiny 

This will map the localhost:3838 to the docker container port 3838.

To map your shinyapp folder ("XXX/energyinsight2.0/shinyapp/") into a folder in the docker container, you can use the command


docker run -dit -p 3838:3838 -v XXX/energyinsight2.0/shinyapp/:/shiny shrektan/shiny


This will create a /shiny folder in the docker container. 


Note. You will have to modify the /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf -> site_dir to point to /shiny in order to use your mappedd code. This change on the system will be erased when you stop the container. If you want it to be permanant, use 

docker commit [containerid] anyname

This will create a new image. next time run with this image instead of shrektan/shiny

======================how to access host ip from inside docker container
If your host compuater is connected to a router, by default, the docker container will obtain another ip through DHCP in router. Appear as in the same local network as the host. Therefore it can access the host through LAN using ip such as 192.168.0.100, etc. 

To access the ip of docker image, in host terminal, use 

docker network list 
to find the network id of the brdige, then 
docker network inspect [id] 
to find the container ipv4 address. 




====================some helpful commands


docker ps -a   # Show all running or created or stopped containers. 

docker inspect [containerid] # The container id is a 12 digit code, inspecting a running container will give you information about the configuration, the exposed port and the ip address of this container. 

docker exec -it [containerid] # This will get into the shell of the container, where you can change configuratin and stuff
